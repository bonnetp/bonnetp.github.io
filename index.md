PhD in Mechanical Modelling of the Source of Glacial Earthquakes in Polar Region (octobre 2017 - june 2021) 

Evaluating glacier mass loss is a current concern to understand the rapid evolution of ice caps related to climate change. Iceberg calving is responsible for an important part of mass loss occurring at the front of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland. Some just-calved thin icebergs are unstable : during capsize, a force is applied to the terminus and is transmitted to the solid earth. Therefore, a long-period (20s- 100s) seism is generated and seismic signal  can be recorded by local and global stations. The emitted seismicity contains precious information about the source mechanisms involved during the calving process.



A versatile mechanical modelling of iceberg capsize has been developed by A. Sergeant et al. . Seismic signals provides constraints on the model and enables the calculation of the iceberg volume and its source dynamics. This model has been first tested on two particular events at the Helheim glacier, Greenland (25 July 2013 at 03:13 UTC and 31 July 2013 at 19:31 UTC) and the results are consistent with the iceberg volume measured separately using images available for this event. Following the work of Amandine Sergeant, a first objective of this PhD is the development and validation of the mechanical model (1) with the validation of the modelling of interaction between the iceberg and the surrounding ocean and (2) with the extension of the modelling to the whole system which account for frictional force between the glacier and the bedrock. A second objective of the PhD is to constrain the mechanical model with seismic signals from events of the last twenty years to evaluate Greenland glacier’s mass loss by icebergs capsize and calving.

My scientific interests :

I am passionate about phenomena related to polar glaciers, iceberg and glacial earthquakes. Thanks to my background in fluid and solid mechanical modelling, glaciology and seismology, I aim to understand the physical dynamic processes occuring in ice sheets.
